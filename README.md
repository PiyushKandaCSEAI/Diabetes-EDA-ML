# Implementation of EDA and ML to a publicly available dataset - Pima Indians dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for detection of Type 2 Diabetes in Females


This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a diabetes dataset using R within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to understand the underlying patterns in the data.

## 📋 Features of the Notebook

- Reading and cleaning the dataset
- Removing duplicate entries
- Converting target variable `Outcome` to a factor
- Generating summary statistics
- Plotting histograms for features
- Creating a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical features

## 🔍 Libraries Used

- `ggplot2`
- `ggcorrplot`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyverse`
- `readr`

## 📊 Heatmap Visualization

The notebook includes a customized correlation heatmap with:
- Gradient coloring
- Labeled correlation coefficients
- Square grid style (using `ggcorrplot`)

## 📁 File

- `EDA_Diabetes_R_Notebook.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with R code.

## ✅ How to Run

You can open this notebook locally in Jupyter Lab/Notebook with an R kernel installed.
